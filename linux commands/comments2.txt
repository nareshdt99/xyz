linux commands,
to switch to root user -  sudo su - 

creating file

1.cat- cat > filename (exit ctrl+d), to add extra content cat >> file1, to see content cat file1

2.touch- to create empty file , used for test purpose. touch filea fileb filec( tocreate multiple files at once)

3.nano - nano file3, (exit ctrl+x, y/n) to addextra content to file repeat same process (no changes in it)

4.vi/vim - vi file4 , then press i(insert mode), enter data then esc:wq! key 

advantages/dis:
1.cat- cant edit only add or over ride data,/( used for reading content) 
2.touch- create empty files
3.nano & vi/vim - editing tools 


creating directories 

1. mkdir - to create directory 

hide files: need to keep dot(.) ahead of file name 
ex: cat > .testfile1
to view hidden files use: ls -al or ls -atl

to create directories side by side: mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
to create directories one insde other : makdir -p dirx/diry/dirz
to get in to dirx need to use :cd dirx
pwd - present working directory (shows the location of directory)
to reach dirz directly from dirx need to use :cd dirx/diry/dirz

to reach dirx directly form dirz need to use :cd ../../..

copy command
cp source destination 
ex: cp file1 dir1 (for moving file in to the directory)
ex: cp -r dir4 dir1 (for mving dir in to directory ) use recursive function (-r)

move command
mv source destination 
ex: mv file1 dir1 (for moving file in to the directory)
ex: mv dir4 dir1 (for moving dir in to the directory) no need of recursive function 

rename command
ex: mv file1 fileabc ( file1 name changed to fileabc) (here destination is undefined so name changes as per destination)

delete command 
1.ex:rm filename
2.ex:rmdir dir
3.ex: rm -f file/dir
4. ex: rm -rf file/dir
mostly used and universal (rm -rf) r-recursive f-forcefully

installing tree: yum install tree -y , and history 

session2
path 
lets say 2 directories dir1 dir2 , need to create file1 inside directory , 
method1: traditional method :go to dir1 (dc dir1)then crete testfile using (cat,touch,nano,vi)
method2; touch dir1/testfile.
lets day dirz is inside diry, diry inside dirx then
ex: touch dirx/diry/dirz testfile 

to view cretared file :ls dirx/diry/dirz/testfile

to add content to file : cat > dirx/diry/dirz/testfile

to copy content to dir :cp tesfilex dirx/diry/dirz (to copy testfilex which is in other diretory to dirz directory)

to copy file in one directory to onother directory :cp dir1/testfile dirx/diry/dirz   (then testfile copies to dirz)

same process to go backwards 
ex:dirx/diry/dirz, we are in dirz , but need to crete file in dirx, then
touch ../../filex (bootm to top)
touch /root/dirx/filex (top to bottom)

/ contains (root, home, etc,temp,....) , then
ls gives visibility of files in root directory (dir1,dir2 or file2,file3,...)
ls / gives visiblity of all directories (root, home, etc,temp,....)

if want to create newfile in home then
to create: touch /home/newfile
to view: ls /home
to remove: rm -rf /home/newfile

if there exist passwd file in etc directory then how to check its content 
cat /etc/passwd

grep  concept  (global regular expression print)
grep is used to find specific word, no of words in given content 
ex: there exist passwd file in etc directory , now task is to find specifiword (say root)in given file , 
since we are in root folder follow below commands
grep root /etc/passwd (grep specificword file location or path)

less, more commands (purpose to read file) to exit need to press "q" key

head,tail commands (purpose to read top or bottom specific no of lines as per requirment) 
if no of lines hasent given then default line size is 10 , 
head /etc/passwd
if to be specific for ex 3 lines thenn
head -3 /etc/passwd

sort command (dosent modify existing content but sort in periodical manner)
ex: sort file1


extra commands 
1.hostname 
2.ifconfig (ip cofig)
3.hostname -i ( private ip)
4.cat os -release ( to check os) command :cat /etc/os-release, or cat/etc/os-rele* (* is saviour or all) 
more ex: cat /etc/*release or cat /etc/*rele*

instalaltion of packages
1.yum (yellodog updater, modifier)
ex: yum install tree -y
ex: yum install httpd -y
ex :yum install docker -y

update packages
ex:yum update httpd -y

remove package
ex; yum remove httpd -y

to check all list of installed packages 
ex: yum list installed

to verify pakage 
ex:which pakage name ex:which tree

to start service for some perticular package
ex:sevice httpd start 
or
ex: systemctl start httpd 

to check current status for some perticular package
ex: service httpd status
oe
ex:systemctl status httpd

restart service 
ex:service httpd reload 

stop service
ex:service httpd stop
ex:systemctl stop httpd 

to start service automaticaaly even after restart then
ex: chkconfig httpd on
or
ex:systemctl enable httpd

to stop service automaticaaly even after restart then
ex:chkconfig httpd off
or
ex:systemctl disable httpd


redirection command (>)
can be used for crete file 
ex: echo"hello" > file3 ( then it creates file3 then drops conent in it (hello))
to add extra content
ex:echo"hello" >> file3 

try : sort filex > file3

which command 
ex:which git

sudo command
ex: sudo su - then goes to /root (can check with pwd)
ex: sudo su   then it goes to /home/ec2-user

imp point
since ec2-user having privilage of root then we can use
ex:sudo yum install httpd -y (when ever we are in main directory need to use sudo command to get root privilages )

whoami command

find command
ex1: find -type f (to find all files in current directory)
ex2: find -type d (to find  directories in current directory)
ex3: find / -type f (to find all files in top level directory)
ex4: find / -type d (to find  directories in top level directory)
ex5: find / -type f -name filename (to find specific file location)
ex6: find / -type d -name dir name (to find specific directory location) (practice with os-release, passwd)

shortcuts

find / -type f -name file3 ( use up arrow to go for previous commands )

if command is huge ex: cat > iwfhioaseuhbviuoaenhuizscnhiynugsszyusdgnyudsgcuyfg 
to delete above command it takes lots of time with backspace , to mae it ease use "ctrl+c"

to copy command in linux just select (highlight) it will by auto copes content,
to paste press right click 

to auto select file/directory from existig file/dir just enter first letter followed by TAB,
ex :file is myfile then enter m follwed by TAB



create user
useradd username 
ex:useradd naresh

user delete
ex:userdel naresh

*passwd file contains all user information*
to check file ex: cat /etc/passwd

create group
groupadd groupname
ex:groupadd devops
to check cat /etc/group,

*if user  created by defalt it cretas group with same name *


to add user to group
ex: gpasswd -a naresh devops

to check cat /etc/group (its shows like devops:x:1003:naresh)

to add mutliple users 
gpasswd -M naresh,nvidia devops (capital M)

remove user
gpasswd -d naresh devops
gpasswd -d naresh,nvidia devops

to login as naresh user instard of ec2-user
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
need to change passwd authentication:yes
then esc then:wq! (to exit)

toset passwd to naresh
ex:passwd naresh (need to enter pass , pass wont be visible)

RESTART :service sshd reload

now login as naresh user (as same as ec-user using public DNS)
 

softlink command (shortcut) (redirects the data)
ex: ln -s file1 softfile1 (-s means soft link) 
or 
ex: ln -s /etc/file1 softfile1 (softfile1 creates in current directory )

check ex: cat softfile1
to find connection ex:ls -l

(if soft file deleted then still can access main file but mailfile deleted then cant access softfie)

 check using ex:ls -l

hard link (data copied) (backup copy)
ex:ln /etc/file1 hardfile1 or ex:ln (original file) (link file)

zip files
tar  (to pak directory) (prpose is not to compress but pakage) ex: dirx.tar
ex:tar -cvf dirx.tar dirx (c-create, v-verbos ,f- forcfully)
gz (zip) (to compress) ex:dirx.tar.gz
ex: gzip dirx.tar


unzip file
ex: gunzip dirx.tar.gz
ex: tar -xvf dirx.tar

yum (install) 
wget (download)

yum update -y

{file r-read/open
     w- write
     x execute
dir   r- see componets inside dir
      w- add/del/rename components
      x- enter inside dir}
 

changing permissions 
method 1: numerical 
r-4, w-2,x-1

for dir drwx r-x r-x
         421 401 401 =755
for file rw- r-- r--
         42  400 400 =644
 command :chmod 755 file1 or chmod 644 file1

to change permissions
comamnd: chmod 755 file1

to make other as root user 
command : chown hari file1 

to change group
command : chgrp devops file1
